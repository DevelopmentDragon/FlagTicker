# FlagTicker
Flag Ticker is a utility tool designed specifically for Half-Life: Negentropy but also compatible with standard Half-Life and GoldSource games.
Its goal is simple, overcome the limitation of flag type variables for use when mapping for GoldSource titles. Of course, this could easily be dealt with an update to existing mapping software, but alas, the maker of this tool has no such reach!
